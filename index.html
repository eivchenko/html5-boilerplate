            <p>Open source software is program in which the source code is allowed to be modified by the general public free of charge.&nbsp; Open source software is usually created in a collaborative manner where developers improve the code and share the changes. Open source software does not just mean its availability of the source code, but the distribution terms that must comply with the following standards:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Free Redistribution - the license must not restrict any user&nbsp; from giving away the software or selling it as part of mass software distribution which consists of programs from different software&rsquo;s.</li>
                <li>Source Code -the source code must be included in the program and the distribution must be allowed and in the compiled version as well.</li>
                <li>Derived Works - derived works and modifications must be allowed. The license must allow modifications to be distributed under the same terms as an original software license.</li>
                <li>Integrity of the Author&rsquo;s Source Code- the modified source-code may be restricted from the distribution if the license allows the distribution of &ldquo;patch-files&rdquo; for the purpose of program modification.</li>
                <li>No Discrimination Against Person or Group - the license shall not discriminate against a group or a person.</li>
                <li>No Discrimination Against Field of Endeavor - the license cannot restrict from anyone making the use of software in specified field of ventures.</li>
                <li>Distribution of License - the rights that are attached to the software must be applied to everybody to whom the software is redistributed to.</li>
                <li>License Must Not Be Specific to a Product - All parties to whom the program was distributed within the terms and conditions of program&rsquo;s license must have the same rights as those that are granted simultaneously with the original software distribution.</li>
                <li>License Must Not Restrict Other Software - license must not demand that other programs distributed under the same instrument must be open-source software.</li>
                <li>License Must Be Technology Neutral - The license shall not be asserted to any specific technology or style of interface.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The distribution of commercial software varies greatly from the distribution of the open source software. In the commercial software before the company can distribute the software to the people, it must negotiate a formal agreement with the owner of the software. As I have described earlier this was not one of the requirements of the open source software, since the open source software allows the software to be edited and copied by anyone.&nbsp; The difference between open source software and commercial software is that most of the time the open source software is developed in collaboration of many developers that work for different companies without any contracts or any formal arrangements.&nbsp;</p>
